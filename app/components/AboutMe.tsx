        My name is Saney Bin Faruk, and I have completed my BSc in Chemistry
        from National University. I am a passionate and dedicated JavaScript
        developer with a strong foundation in various modern web technologies.
        My expertise spans across React.js, Next.js, Node.js, and React Native,
        allowing me to build dynamic and responsive web applications. I am
        proficient in state management using Redux and Zustand and have hands-on
        experience with both MySQL and MongoDB for database management.
        <br />
        <br />I am also skilled in Tailwind CSS for crafting visually appealing
        user interfaces and have integrated Stripe for payment processing in
        several projects. Additionally, I have a keen interest in Unity Game
        Development. I am always eager to learn new technologies and take on
        challenges, making me a versatile and resourceful team player.
        <br />
        <br />I am now seeking opportunities to leverage my skills and
        contribute to innovative projects as a React.js developer. I am
        committed to continuous improvement and am excited to bring my unique
        blend of skills and experience to a dynamic development team.
